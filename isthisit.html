            <h1>Is This It</h1>

                When Is This It dropped in 2001, it kind of felt like everything changed overnight. The Strokes, five guys from New York City, came in with this effortlessly cool, raw sound that cut through all the glossy pop and overproduced rock that was everywhere at the time. It felt real. Gritty. Like something you’d hear blasting from a basement show in the East Village at 2 a.m.
The band recorded the album with producer Gordon Raphael, and they kept things super stripped-down—no fancy tricks, barely any overdubs, just straight-up analog gear and attitude. Julian Casablancas’ vocals had that lazy drawl, the guitars tangled perfectly, and the drums hit with this tight, urgent energy. Songs like “Last Nite,” “Someday,” and “Hard to Explain” weren’t just catchy — they felt iconic the second you heard them.
Interestingly, there was a bit of drama with the U.S. release — they ended up swapping out the track “New York City Cops” after 9/11 out of respect, which added even more buzz around the album.
In the end, Is This It wasn’t just a debut — it was a cultural moment. It kicked off a whole wave of garage rock revival bands and reminded everyone that rock music could still be cool, dirty, and dangerous. Even now, over two decades later, it still holds up.
