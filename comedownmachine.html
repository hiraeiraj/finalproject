            <h1>Comedown Machine</h1>
            <p> Released on March 26, 2013</p>
            <!--Text generated by ChatGPT (chat.openai.com) -->
            <p> By the time Comedown Machine dropped in 2013, The Strokes were fully doing their own thing — and kind of daring you to keep up. This album didn’t come with a big promo push, no major interviews, barely any shows. The band even ditched putting their faces on the cover — it just said “Comedown Machine” in red Helvetica, like an old RCA tape reel. It felt low-key… but the music? Totally not.
                If Angles was them experimenting, Comedown Machine was them going full-on weird and cool with it. There’s a slick, almost 80s vibe across the whole album — a lot more synths, falsetto vocals from Julian (see: “One Way Trigger”), and unexpected turns. It’s polished but playful, with tracks like “Tap Out,” “Welcome to Japan,” and “Chances” showing off a version of The Strokes that was looser, more adventurous, and maybe not trying to be anyone’s favorite band — just being themselves.
                And yet, for all its curveballs, there’s still that Strokes DNA in there. “All the Time” could’ve easily fit on their earlier records, and songs like “50/50” prove they could still bring the raw, noisy energy when they felt like it.
                Comedown Machine is often the overlooked middle child in their discography, but it’s kind of a hidden gem. It’s strange, stylish, and surprisingly emotional — like the sound of a band doing exactly what they want, whether the world’s watching or not.</p>
