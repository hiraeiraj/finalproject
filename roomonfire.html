            <h1>Room on Fire</h1>
            <p> Released on October 28, 2003</p>
            <!--Text generated by ChatGPT (chat.openai.com) -->
            <p> Following up a debut as beloved as Is This It? Yeah, no pressure. But in 2003, The Strokes came back swinging with Room on Fire. It was sharper, tighter, and somehow even cooler — without trying too hard. They didn’t reinvent their sound, and honestly, they didn’t need to. This was The Strokes refining their formula, not changing it.
                They teamed up again with producer Gordon Raphael and recorded the album pretty fast — you can feel it in the songs. There’s a kind of urgency, like they knew exactly what they wanted. Tracks like “Reptilia,” “12:51,” and “Under Control” showed the band leaning a little more into 80s influences, especially with those synthy guitar tones and tight rhythms, but it all still had that unmistakable Strokes attitude.
                Room on Fire didn’t hit quite as hard critically as their debut — but over time, it’s become a fan favorite. A lot of people now see it as the perfect companion to Is This It. It’s moody, confident, and full of the kind of songs that sound best at night with the windows down.
                This album proved The Strokes weren’t a one-album wonder — they were here to stay.</p>
