            <h1>First Impressions of Earth</h1>
            <p>Released on December 30, 2005</p>

            <p> By the time First Impressions of Earth came out in 2006, The Strokes had something to prove. They’d already nailed the “cool New York band” thing — twice — but this time around, they weren’t content to stick to the script. This album was louder, darker, and way more unpredictable than anything they’d done before.
                It kicked off with “You Only Live Once,” which felt like classic Strokes — tight, catchy, effortless. But then came “Juicebox,” and suddenly everything got way more aggressive. Heavy bass, wild energy, and Julian practically shouting. It was divisive, for sure, but also kind of thrilling. The whole album plays like the sound of a band pushing against their own walls.
                They brought in a new producer for this one — David Kahne — and you can hear the difference. The songs are more polished in places, but also more chaotic in others. Tracks like “Heart in a Cage,” “Razorblade,” and “Ask Me Anything” showed off a band willing to experiment, even if it meant alienating a few fans.
                First Impressions of Earth didn’t get the same instant love as the first two albums, but over time, people have really come around to it. It’s bold, messy, and full of moments that hit harder than you expect. For some fans, it’s actually their favorite — a wild, unpredictable ride that showed The Strokes weren’t afraid to evolve.</p>
